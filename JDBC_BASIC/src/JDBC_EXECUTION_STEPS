1.  We required three things localHost/globalHost url, user,password
2.  Load driver by using Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver");
3.  Exception handling is required whenever we connect with database.
4.  So Class.forName can throws exception() we need to handle it.
5.  Exception reason : The specified class (e.g., "org.postgresql.Driver") is not found in the classpath.
            try {
                Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver");
            } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
                System.out.println("JDBC Driver not found: " + e.getMessage());
            }
6.  We have 4 JDBC components :- DriverManager Class , Connection Interface , Statement
            and prepared statement Interface , ResultSet Interface
7.  In DriverManager Class we have .getConnection Method which takes three agr :-
            localHost url , user , password
8.  There is a exception called "SQLException" can comes while connecting to db so we need to handle it.
9.  DriverManger.getConnection(localhost url , user,password) , connection established.
10. Now it need to store somewhere so that Connection interface works here.
11. Connection conn = Driver.getConnection(localhost,user,password);
12. To execute SQL query we need to use Statement interface , CreateStatement is
            not available to Statement, it is present to  Connection Class
            so we can access it using con.createStatement();
13. Now we need to do CRUD operation of as we do in sql and stored in string  called "query".
14. Now It's time to execute data from db so we will use "statement.executeQuery"
15. statement.executeQuery(query) is used when we want to Fetch data from database
16. But when we required to update data we will use statement.updateQuery(query);
17. So statement.executeQuery() returns whole table from so it need to store somewhere so ResultSet works here.
18. resultSet.next() tells is there any element if yes return true else false
            (So while loop can be used for access all table).
19. If db returns int value we can do "resultSet.getInt()" if String "resultSet.getString()"


--------------------------------------QUERY FOR CRUD OPERATION--------------------------

1.  UPDATING VALUE : "UPDATE students SET age = ? WHERE student_id = ?"
2.  DELETING VALUE : "DELETE FROM students WHERE student_id = ?";
3.  INSERT VALUE   : "INSERT INTO students(name,age,gender,email) VALUES(?,?,?,?)";
