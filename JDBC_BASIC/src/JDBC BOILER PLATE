1.  We required three things localHost/globalHost url, user,password
2.  Load driver by using Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver");
3.  Exception handling is required whenever we connect with database.
4.  So Class.forName can throws exception90() we need to handle it.
5.  Exception reason : The specified class (e.g., "org.postgresql.Driver") is not found in the classpath.
            try {
                Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver");
            } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
                System.out.println("JDBC Driver not found: " + e.getMessage());
            }
6.  We have 4 JDBC components :- DriverManager Class , Connection Interface , Statement
            and prepared statement Interface , ResultSet Interface
7.  In DriverManager Class we have .getConnection Method which takes three agr :-
            localHost url , user , password
8.  There is a exception called "SQLException" can comes while connecting to db so we need to handle it.
9.  DriverManger.getConnection(localhost url , user,password) , connection established.
10. Now it need to store somewhere so that Connection interface works here.
11. Connection conn = Driver.getConnection(localhost,user,password);
12. To execute SQL query we need to use Statement interface , CreateStatement is
            not available to Statement, it is present to  Connection Class
            so we can acces it using con.createStatement();
